# Static-Malware-Analysis
This is a program that scans all running `exe files` in your computer. A hash of all the files is sent to `VirusTotal API`, which return a status i.e. if a malware is found or not.
If found, the program terminates that running process.

## Requirements
- An account on VirusTotal (https://www.virustotal.com/gui/) to get your `API Key`. 
- `File.bat` should be run with Admin privileges.
- A working python environment (like Jupiter, pycharm, spyder) with following packages installed -
	- os
	- wmi
	- psutil
	- time
	- requests

**Note: Make sure to set your own API Key so that the code works properly.**
